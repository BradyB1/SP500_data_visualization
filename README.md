# SP500_data_visualization
In this class group project, my group members and I worked on a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the S&P500. We sorted through the S&P500 using the FRED API, yfinance API,and other datasets provided in the repo, to answer various statistical queries and draw informed conclusions. Attached, there is a notebook containing all of the code and the datasets/files needed for running the code. Feel free to reach out if you would like our presentation or demo video.
