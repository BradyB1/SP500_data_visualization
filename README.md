# SP500_data_visualization
In this class group project, we worked to visualize different aspects of the S&P500. We observed correlation of many different variables and plotted them to reveal a story. Attached, there is a notebook containing all of the code and the datasets/files needed for running the code. Feel free to reach out if you would like our presentation or demo video.
