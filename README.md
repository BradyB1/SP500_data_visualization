# SP500_data_visualization
In this class group project, we worked to visualize different aspects of the S&amp;P500. We observed correlation of many different variables and plotted them to reveal a story. Attached, there is a notebook containing all of the code, a demo video of the code in action, and our final group presentation in which we speak about the work completed.
